# LAB-ASSESMENT-1-GL

I have uploaded my LAB1 project with the following structure :
  
  
  src:
  
  
    model package - employee class.
    
    service package - credential services interface
                    - credential services implementaion.
                    
    test package - testing java class.
    
  
 Additional feature :
 instead of fiximg the name to "Harshit" , i have created the porject such that  any new user can enter his/her name and the credentials such as email and password will be generated for them accordingly.
